No Not at all If you look at what happened in Minnesota they were getting decimated and after three days of watching it I demanded that the National Guard be utilized and in one day it was over In fact they got there at a certain time in the late afternoon and by the time they finished it was I always say a somewhat sarcastically but the safest place on earth to and Minnesota was really really having a hard time and we took care of it The governor is a nice man and he was not using enough and he was You saw the police were running in Minneapolis and they were running away from their precinct which is something I’ve never seen before You have a liberal mayor that frankly was having a lot of trouble and you have a very liberal mayor in New York too Do you notice that all of these places that have problems are not run by Republicans they’re run by Liberal Democrats so there is something into that philosophy and yet they’re also the ones keeping everybody locked up in their apartments and their homes for too long a period of time so it’s very interesting how that changes but no the National Guard we could solve that problem in New York and in fact if they don’t get their act straightened out I will solve it I’ll solve it fast
